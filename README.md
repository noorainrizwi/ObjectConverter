# ObjectConverter
Annotation based converter which generate class and method to convert one object to another and vice-versa.

## Annotations
**Model:**
Model is a class level annotation which helps identify which two object will be converted to one another based on converterName attribute of the annotation.

**Attribute:**
Attribute is a field level annotaion with two attribute
1. required: a boolean attribute which marks the field as required for conversion. If field is marked as required and another class does not have the mapping field error will be thrown.
2. id: use to map field of two classes

## Prerequisite
1. Classes annotated with @Model must have a default constructor.
2. Fields annotated with @Attribute must have getter and setter defined.

## Working
When a class is annotated with @Model, the ObjectConverter uses the converterName attribute of annotation to find another class annotated with @Model having the same converterName. Exactly two class should have the same value for converterName. ObjectConverter uses the converterName as className for the new converter class that will be created. Newly created class will be created in com.converter package and will have two static methods with following signature
1. public static Class2 convertClass1ToClass2(Class1)
2. public static Class1 convertClass2ToClass1(Class2)

id attribute of @Attribute annotation is used to map the fields in these two classes. These fileds must have same data type, setter and getter method defined for them. By default required attribute is false, if marked as true then in another class there must be a field with same id in order to create the converter class.

## Example
```
@Model(converterName="StudentEmployeeConverter")
public class Student{
    @Attribute(id="name")
    private String name;
    
    @Attribute(id="identifier", required=true)
    private String roll;
    
    @Attribute(id="org")
    private String school;
    
    @Attribute("clazz")
    private String clazz;
    
    // Getter and Setters for these methods
}

@Model(converterName="StudentEmployeeConverter")
public class Employee{
    @Attribute(id="name")
    private String name;
    
    @Attribute(id="identifier", required=true)
    private String employeeId;
    
    @Attribute(id="org")
    private String company;
    
    @Attribute("dept")
    private String department;
    
    // Getter and Setters for these methods
}


// Code generated by ObjectConverter in com.converter package
public class StudentEmployeeConverter{
    public static Employee convertStudentToEmployee(Student object){
        Employee variable = new Employee();
        variable.setName(object.getName());
        variable.setEmployeeId(object.getRoll());
        variable.setCompany(object.getSchool());
        return variable;
    }
    
    public static Student convertEmployeeToStudent(Employee object){
        Student variable = new Student();
        variable.setName(object.getName());
        variable.setRoll(object.getEmployeeId());
        variable.setSchool(object.getCompany());
        return variable;
    }
}
```
